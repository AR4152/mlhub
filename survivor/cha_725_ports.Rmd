# Ports Data Visualisation {#ports}

`r CiteDate(20210324)` Visualisations of or data is crucial to gaining
insight into the data.

The examples here come from chapter 5 of the Essentials of Data
Science by Graham Williams <https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science>.
The data used comes from <https://essentials.togaware.com/ports.xlsx>.

[MLHub](https://mlhub.ai)'s [rain](https://github.com/gjwgit/ports)
package uses the [Australian Sea
Ports](https://essentials.togaware.com/ports.xlsx) which is provided
as an Excel spreadsheet. 

We install, configure and demonstrate the model with these three
commands:

```bash
ml install ports
ml configure ports
ml demo ports
```

## ports demo
