# MLHub Command Line

`r CiteDate(20200901)` The machine learning hub (`r Link("MLHub",
"https://mlhub.ai")`) is a framework and repository, through which the
capabilities of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data
Science are presented and accessible.  Pre-built Machine Learning and
Artificial Intelligence models as well as Data Science best practices
are presented as packages. Each package wraps its functionality into
commands that are able to be readily deployed within traditional and
powerful Unix/Linux command line pipelines.

Each MLHub package provides a **demo** command to interactively
demonstrate the capabilities of the package. A **gui** command
presents a graphical user interface through which to use the
particular capabilities of the package.  The command line oriented
commands then empower the user with the capabilities of AI and ML.

Whilst the power of the command line is an important goal of MLHub,
its usefulness must be able to be demonstrated within 5 minutes. You
decide whether the package supports something useful for you, or move
on having lost only 5 minutes of your time.

A MLHub **yaml** file is all that is required to turn a
`r Link("git", "https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/git")` 
based repository (where researchers today publish
their algorithms) into quickly accessible and ready to
run, explore, rebuild, and even deploy, pre-built machine learning
models.  The models and technology are
accessed and managed using the `r Command(ml)` command from the free
(as in libre) and open source
`r Link("mlhub", "https://github.com/mlhubber/mlhub")` software. The software
is available for installation through
`r Link("pypi", "https://pypi.org/project/mlhub/")`.

Getting started is simple for computers running Ubuntu LTS.  The
command line tools support
`r Link("visualisations", "https://github.com/gjwgit/ports")` and
`r Link("animations", "https://github.com/gjwgit/animate")`, machine learning
models for `r Link("rain prediction", "https://github.com/gjwgit/rain")` and
`r Link("movie recommendation", "https://github.com/gjwgit/movies")`, and AI
models to
`r Link("colorize photos", "https://github.com/mlhubber/colorize")`, 
`r Link("identify objects", "https://github.com/mlhubber/objects")`, and to
`r Link("detect faces", "https://github.com/simonzhaoms/facedetect")`.

MLHub runs on Ubuntu LTS (18.04 and 20.04). This might be installed on
Windows 10 as the Windows Subsystem for Linux or native on the
Raspberry Pi. Ubuntu can of course run native on your own desktop or
laptop where it is easy to install. Also it is available from the
Hyper-V gallery on Windows (enable Hyper-V and choose Ubuntu). For
MacOS X use Parallels or Virtual Box to install from the Ubuntu
**iso**. It also runs well on cloud Ubuntu servers.

## Installing MLHub

`r CiteDate(20200220)` `r Link("MLHub","https://mlhub.ai")` is a
platform specifically built on Ubuntu. We start with a fresh install
of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and note otherwise that some of the steps here may
not be necessary.

To simplify using the Ubuntu system we will use the `r Command(wajig)`
system administration suite. `r Package(wajig, "Wajig")` is available from
the Debian and Ubuntu repositories with the latest updates available
from `r Link("PyPI", "https://pypi.org/project/wajig/")`. Installation of
`r Package(wajig)` will usually take less than 5 minutes.

```bash
$ sudo apt install wajig
$ wajig update 
$ wajig upgrade 
$ wajig install python3-pip
$ pip3 install wajig
```

Be sure to log out and log back in after the `r Command(pip3)` install
so that the system will notice your local installation of
`r Command(wajig)`.

Now we are ready to install and configure MLHub:

```bash
$ pip3 install mlhub
$ ml configure
```

If you now find that the `r Command(ml)` command is not found then you
may like to log out and back in again. This will refresh the PATH
where commands are found. The default in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is that the
path will include `~/.local/bin` if it exists, which won't be the
case for the first time. `r Command(pip3, "Pip3")` will install the
`r Command(ml)` command there and this is checked at login. If all else
fails then the following could be useful (but not usually required):

```bash
$ echo 'PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
```

MLHub exposes a github repository as a collection of quickly
accessible and ready to run, explore, rebuild, and even deploy,
pre-built machine learning models and data science technology.  The
models and technology are accessed and managed using the ml command
from the mlhub package available for quick installation from pypi. A
growing number of machine learning models and data science technology
are becoming available, as well as cloud based services.

The **configure** of `r Command(ml)` as above will install quite a
comprehensive collection of AI technology to have your computer
AI-ready. This will include several hundred packages (mostly small)
that are downloaded and installed. For each of the major packages you
will be asked to confirm that it is okay to install it. This could
take up to 5 minutes.

This will install quite a collection of free and open source packages
that begins to form a foundation for doing AI and ML and Data Science
on Ubuntu. Included is the `r Link("R Statistical Software", "https://r-project.org")` package.

As the instructions will suggest, run the following to immediately
turn on tab expansion for mlhub commands and model names. This will be
available anyhow on the next login.

```bash
$ source /etc/bash_completion.d/ml.bash
```
