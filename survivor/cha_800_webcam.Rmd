# webcam --- WebCam Image Manipulation {#webcam}

`r CiteDate(20200405)` See <https://gitlab.com/kayontoga/webcam> for details.

This package creates a new dummy webcam device through which video
conferencing applications, such as Zoom, can source their video feeds
that are broadcast to the video conference. Video processing of the
video stream from an actual webcam can then be performed to provide
various privacy options.
