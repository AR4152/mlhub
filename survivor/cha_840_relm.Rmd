# RelM Differential Privacy {#relm}

`r CiteDate(20210327)` This package demonstrates the utilisation of
differential privacy to protect the privacy of data within a
database. A query of the database will return the data perturbed by a
certain amount. That is, if the actual result is 243, the query might
return 245 one time, 242 another time. 

The differential privacy libraries support the concept of a privacy
budget which allows a certain number of queries before further queries
can no longer assure privacy. Intuitively, the more perturbation, the
larger is the privacy budget, and so the more queries that can be
supported before the budget is spent.
