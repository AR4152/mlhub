***"The enjoyment of one's tools is an essential ingredient of
successful work."*** *Donald E. Knuth*

**This book is undergoing conversion from LaTeX to Bookdown. It is a
work in progress and there remains numerous glitches. Please bare with
us.**

Welcome to the world of Accessible Machine Learning algorithms,
Artificial Intelligence knowledge structures and reasoning, and Data
Science practises. [MLHub](https://mlhub.ai) is an innovative software
framework that aims to provide ready access to ML, AI, and Data
Science. It is an ecosystem to share experiences through the freedom
of open source---the freedom to do as you want, when you want, and
where you want, with the software from the ecosystem. There are very
few, and ideally no, restrictions. Your obligation is to maintain our
freedoms and as you extend and build on the software others have made
available to you, please freely contribute back to the ecosystem.

The aim of this book is to quickly get started with MLHub, and to
deliver the excitement of a fun and productive environment for
exploring the state-of-the-art. MLHub is a complete and mature
framework that strives to achieve the goal of making the technology
accessible beyond technically most advanced. Our goal for each package
is to demonstrate the specific technology within 5 minutes, for you to
then decide if it is useful technology or not. If not, move on. If it
is, then the package can be further explored and utilised.

MLHub is implemented in Python on Ubuntu GNU/Linux. GNU/Linux is the
most productive platform for learning about, utilising, developing and
deploying Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Data
Science. It has been the platform of choice for developers for over 30
years. The book begins with a guide to getting started with Ubuntu
GNU/Linux on any platform, and installing MLHub. The [GNU/Linux
Desktop Survival Guide](https://linux.togaware.com/survivor/) provides
a comprehensive guide to using GNU/Linux.

The second part of the book guides the reader through the many
different Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science
packages available through MLHub. The breadth of available packages is
comprehensive, and the depth ranges from simple introductory
technology to the current state-of-the-art algorithms. The focus is on
utilising the technology. The [Data Science Desktop Survival
Guide](https://onepager.togaware.com/) provides a
comprehensive guide to Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and
Data Science.

The book concludes with a guide and in-depth look at the MLHub
framework. If you plan to package your research outcomes as an MLHub
package then this is for you.

## About this Book {-}
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

`r CiteDate(20210223)` Since beginning the survival guide books in
1995 they have grown in all kinds of directions. My original aim was
to capture useful notes for the varied and many common tasks we find
ourselves doing, utilising the tools and packages of GNU/Linux. I
structured the book as one page nuggets of information, that is, each
section within a chapter is limited to a single printed page, and is
focused on a single task. 

The concept of the OnePageR Desktop Survival Guide has worked well
over the years, from my personal use and your feedback. Three Desktop
Survival Guides exist, the [GNU/Linux Desktop Survival
Guide](https://linux.togaware.com/survivor/), the [Data Science
Desktop Survival Guide](https://onepager.togaware.com/), and the
[MLHub Desktop Survival Guide](https://mlhub.ai/survivor/). The
material from these freelyt available books has also lead to the
commercial publication of two books (Data Mining with
Rattle)[https://bit.ly/rattle_data_mining] and (Essentials of Data
Science)[https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science].

Readers are invited to send corrections, comments, suggestions, and
updates to survivor@togaware.com. Your feedback is most welcome and
will be acknowledged within the book.

A **pdf** version of this book is available for a small donation which
goes towards supporting the development and availability of the
book. Please visit `r Link("MLHub","https://mlhub.ai")` for
details. The **html** version contains the same material and remains
freely available from `r Link("MLHub", "https://mlhub.ai")`.

This book is produced using
[bookdown](https://bookdown.org). [Emacs](https://emacs.org) is used
to edit the text.  Many will be using [RStudio](https://rstudio.com)
to edit their bookdown documents, which is a generally more friendly
environment and is the environment of choice for bookdown
support. I've used Emacs since 1985 and as a fully extensible
"kitchen-sink" type of editor, it has served me well for over 35
years, despite numerous flirtations with "better" editors over my
career. RStudio and [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) come close.

Bookdown is an [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) based
platform for intermixing text with executable code (like Python, R and
Shell code blocks). Rmarkdown itself utilises the simple
[markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) syntax to markup the
sections of a document. After running
[knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) over the rmarkdown material a
markdown document is produced, including the output of an commands
that were run.

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is utilised to produce **html** from the
markdown document. this can be publsihed to the world wide web. It can
also produce **pdf** output utilising
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), converting the markdown into
LaTeX markup, with [xetex](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/) used to then
convert that to **pdf**.

All these tools are open source software and available on multiple
platforms, and all for free.

Many books are today being written using bookdown. Examples include 
`r Link("Data Science at the Command Line","https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/1e/")` 
(`r Link("github","https://github.com/jeroenjanssens/data-science-at-the-command-line")`); 
`r Link("Efficient R Programming","https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/index.html")`
(`r Link("github", "https://github.com/csgillespie/efficientR")`).

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
## Terminology {-}
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

*GNU/Linux* refers to the GNU environment and the GNU and other
applications running in that environment on top of the Linux operating
system kernel.

*Ubuntu* and its underlying base distribution *Debian* are
complete repository based distributions which include many
applications pre-built for the particular choice of operating system
kernel. The repositories house pre-built packages ready to be
installed.

*X Window System* is the common windowing system used in Ubuntu and
is a separate complementary component to the operating system itself.

*Microsoft Windows* (or *MS/Windows* and less informatively just
*Windows*) usually refers to the whole of the popular operating
system, from kernel to applications, irrespective of which version of
Microsoft Windows is being run, unless the version is important.
Microsoft Windows is one of many windowing systems and came on to the
screen rather later than the pioneering Apple Macintosh windowing
system and the Unix windowing systems. We will refer to MS/Windows
version 10 as the *last* release of this Microsoft operating system,
which going forward has snapshot releases rather than new versions.

the idea of MLHub originally with the idea of a repository of
pre-built deep neural network models. Simon Zhao and Fang Zhou
implemented some of the early prototypes of the system. Anthony Nolan
and many others have provided insights and comments that have been
incorporated somewhere in the software and/or book. Thanks.

Writing of this book began in 1995 in one form or another, and the
material continues to be updated as the technology develops. The
procedures and applications presented in this book and through the
various MLHub packages have been included for their instructional
value. They have been tested at various times over the years but are
not guaranteed for any particular purpose.  We also note that
functionality of different applications can change over time and
whilst we make an effort to update the material the sheer volume
presents a challenge. The publisher,
