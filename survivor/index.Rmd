***"The enjoyment of one's tools is an essential ingredient of
successful work."*** *Donald E. Knuth*

**This book is undergoing conversion from LaTeX to Bookdown. It is a
work in progress and there remains numerous glitches. Please bare with
us.**

Welcome to the world of Accessible Artificial Intelligence, Machine
Learning, and Data Science. MLHub is an innovative software framework
that aims to provide ready access to AI, ML, and Data Science
technology. It is an ecosystem to share experiences through the
freedom of open source---the freedom to do as you want with the software, with very few,
and ideally no, restrictions, except the requirement to maintain our
freedoms.

The aim of this book is to quickly get started with MLHub, and to
deliver the excitement of a fun and productive environment for
exploring the technology. MLHub is a complete and mature framework
that strives to achieve the goal of making the technology accessible.

This book provides a guide to the many different packages available
for MLHub. It aims to be comprehensive, beginning with basic
introductions to AI, ML, and Data Science, followed by a guide to
getting started with MLHub. We then showcase many MLHub packages.

The basis of our ecosystem is freedom: the freedom to choose, the
freedom to learn, the freedom to change, the freedom to share, the
freedom to contribute, the freedom to live, the freedom to enjoy, and
the freedom to communicate through the code and tools we write. Never
let that freedom be taken from us.

On completing an install of MLHub it is ready to use with all of the
packages that have been made available.  All of the major classes of
AI, ML, and Data Science capabilities are covered in this book.

## About this Book {-}
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

`r CiteDate(20210223)` This book has been a work in progress since
1995, and just as the world of Artificial Intelligence continues to
develop and expand so does this book and indeed, so does MLHub. Every
section (eventually) will begin with a date that indicates the
currency of the section---when it was last reviewed and/or updated.

Since beginning the survival guide books in 1995 they have grown in
all kinds of directions. My original aim was to capture useful notes
for the varied and many common tasks we find ourselves doing,
utilising the tools and packages of GNU/Linux. I structured the book
as one page nuggets of information. That is, each section within a
chapter targeted a single printed page, and focused on a single
task. This was the origin of my OnePageR Desktop Survival Guides. It
seems to have worked well over the years, from my personal use and
your feedback. This material has also lead to the publication of two
books.

Readers are invited to send corrections, comments, suggestions, and
updates to me at Graham.Williams@togaware.com. Your feedback is most
welcome and will be acknowledged within the book.

A **pdf** version of this book is available for a small donation which
goes towards supporting the development and availability of the
book. Please visit `r Link("Togaware","https://mlhub.ai")` for
details. The **html** version contains the same material and remains
freely available from `r Link("Togaware", "https://mlhub.ai")`.

**Production**

This book is produced using bookdown. Emacs is used to edit the text.
Many will be using RStudio to edit their bookdown
documents, which is a generally more friendly environment and is the
environment of choice for bookdown support. I've used Emacs since 1985
and as a fully extensible "kitchen-sink" type of editor, it has served
me well for over 35 years, despite numerous flirtations with "better"
editors over my career. RStudio and Visual Studio Code come close.

Bookdown is an rmarkdown based platform for intermixing text with
executable code (like Python, R and Shell code blocks). Rmarkdown
itself utilises the simple markdown syntax to markup the sections of a
document. After running knitr over the rmarkdown material a markdown
document is produced. 

Pandoc is then utilised to produce **html** which is published on the
Web. For the **pdf** output pandoc utilises LaTeX, converting the
markdown into LaTeX markup, with xetex used to then convert that to
**pdf**. 

All these tools are open source software and available on multiple
platforms.

Many books are today being written using bookdown. Examples include 
`r Link("Data Science at the Command Line","https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/1e/")` 
(`r Link("github","https://github.com/jeroenjanssens/data-science-at-the-command-line")`); 
`r Link("Efficient R Programming","https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/index.html")`
(`r Link("github", "https://github.com/csgillespie/efficientR")`).

**What's In A Name**

*GNU/Linux* refers to the GNU environment and the GNU and other
applications running in that environment on top of the Linux operating
system kernel.

*Ubuntu* and its underlying base distribution *Debian* are
complete repository based distributions which include many
applications pre-built for the particular choice of operating system
kernel. The repositories house pre-built packages ready to be
installed.

*X Window System* is the common windowing system used in Ubuntu and
is a separate complementary component to the operating system itself.

*Microsoft Windows* (or *MS/Windows* and less informatively just
*Windows*) usually refers to the whole of the popular operating
system, from kernel to applications, irrespective of which version of
Microsoft Windows is being run, unless the version is important.
Microsoft Windows is one of many windowing systems and came on to the
screen rather later than the pioneering Apple Macintosh windowing
system and the Unix windowing systems. We will refer to MS/Windows
version 10 as the *last* release of this Microsoft operating system,
which going forward has snapshot releases rather than new versions.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
## Organisation of the Book {-}
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

`r CiteDate(20200218)` Individual chapters aim to be a standalone
reference using a one-pager style whereby each individual page aims to
be a standalone guide on a specific point or topic. This one-page
concept comes from my `r Link("OnePageR", "https://onepager.togaware.com")`
book for data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning
and has been quite successful there. 

The introductory chapters introduce AI, ML, and Data Science. But for
a more in-depth guide to doing AI, Machine Learning and Data Science,
see the Data Science Desktop Survival Guide.

The first part of the book covers AI in general. The second part
introduces the MLHub framework for accessible AI. The third part then
showcases many of the MLHub packages. The fourth part of the book
provides a guide to building a package for MLHub.

So sit back and enjoy the freedom and liberty that comes with free
software. Also, please consider becoming an active part of the
community that is making computers and the applications they run 
and the data they collect a
benefit to society world wide, rather than a privilege of the few.

`r CiteDate(20210223)` There are many people to thank for sharing these tools,
their knowledge, and their encouragement in many different
ways. Indeed, the open source communities are characterised by their
willingness to share for the good of us all, and many folk have also
contributed directly and indirectly to this book through their

there are always gaps. To all who share openly, thank you. I have

support is used to contribute toward the costs of running the servers
used to make this book available. Donations can be made through PayPal
at <https://mlhub.ai/>

The following have contributed to the content of the book and MLHub
with specific material in one way or another. XXXX sparked the idea of
MLHub originally. Simon Zhao and Fang Zhou
implemented some of the early version of the system. Anthony Nolan
and many many others have provided insights and comments that have
been incorporated somewhere in the software and/or book. Thanks.
