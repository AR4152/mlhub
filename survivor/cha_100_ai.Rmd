# (PART) Getting Started {-}

# AI, Machine Learning, Data Science {#ai}

`r CiteDate(20200223)` GNU/Linux is a very productive platform for
learning about, utilising, developing and deploying Machine Learning
algorithms, Artificial Intelligence models and Data Science services
(MLAIDS). It has been the platform of choice for developers for nearly
30 years.

The goal of this chapter is to share the power of this suite of
technology to the general computer user, making the latest
developments accessible.. Often technology gets dumbed down to achieve
widespread use but it leads to little or to no understanding. Our aim
is to simplify access to technology whist educating users along the way.

So what is Artificial Intelligence? Many definitions exist and have
changed over time, often to incorporate some latest technology that
needs a marketing boost! It's useful to go back to the origins from a
`r Link("workshop in 1956 at Dartmouth College","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop")`
in the USA funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. The workshop agreed
on the term artificial intelligence and proposed that it encapsulated:

```
an attempt to find how to make machines use language, form
abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for
humans, and improve themselves. â€¦  For the present purpose the
artificial intelligence problem is taken to be that of making a
machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human
were so behaving.
```

That's quite broad but we note that machine learning is a key element,
as is language, and alluding to knowledge representation as
abstractions and concepts, with a purpose of problem solving.
Learning of course is also core to the human experience of
intelligence.

Data Science, which as a term has gained currency since 2014, is a
profession oriented endeavour of using both Machine Learning and AI
technology (plus Statistics) to deliver new insights and knowledge
from data.

This chapter highlights this exciting area of technological
development in the context of GNU/Linux as an enabling operating
system. The `r Link("MLHub", "https://mlhub.ai")` will be utilised as the
platform through which AI, machine learning and data science are
explored. The MLHub, put simply, aims to share the latest algorithms
and models within a framework that is easy for people to build the
models to share and a platform that is easy for anyone to explore.

## AI Generations

**20201024**

The later 2010's saw the emergence of the fourth AI revolution. We
might characterise these eras of AI as follows:

**Search** The 1950's saw reasoning as search. Natural language,
micro worlds, and neural networks all featured during this time.

**Knowledge Representation** The 1980's saw a surge in expert systems,
knowledge representation, and back propagation.

**Agents** The 1990's saw a focus on agents. Deep Blue,
intelligent agents and the emergence of Data Mining.

**Massive Data and Compute** The 2010's saw the emergence of data
science and deep learning made possible by the coupling of accessible
massive compute on the cloud and the centralised collection of massive
amounts of personal data.

The **Future** will see a resurgence of interest in causal
reasoning, knowledge graphs (frames), accessible AI, and federated
data privacy.
