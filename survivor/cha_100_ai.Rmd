# Artificial Intelligence {#ai}

`r CiteDate(20200223)` Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been variously
defined over time. It often incorporates some latest technology that
needs a marketing boost! So it's useful to go back to the origins from
a `r Link("workshop in 1956 at Dartmouth
College","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop")` in the
USA funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. The workshop agreed on the
term artificial intelligence and proposed that it encapsulated:

> an attempt to find how to make machines use language, form
	abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for
	humans, and improve themselves. â€¦  For the present purpose the
	artificial intelligence problem is taken to be that of making a
	machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human
	were so behaving.

That's quite broad but we note that Machine Learning is a key element,
as is language, and alluding to knowledge representation as
abstractions and concepts, with a purpose of problem solving.
Learning of course is also core to the human experience of
intelligence.

Data Science, which as a term has gained currency since 2014, is a
profession oriented endeavour of using both Machine Learning and
Artificial Intelligence technology (plus Statistics) to deliver new
insights and knowledge from data. It is the translational

Since those early days of Artificial Intelligence we have seen four
"revolutions" or surges in AI.  The 1950's saw reasoning as **search**
with developments in natural language, micro worlds, and neural
networks all featured during this time. The 1980's saw a surge in
expert systems, **knowledge representation**, and back
propagation. The 1990's saw a focus on **agents** with Deep Blue,
intelligent agents and the emergence of Data Mining.  The 2010's saw
the emergence of **massive data and compute**, with data science and
deep learning made possible by the coupling of accessible massive
compute on the cloud and the centralised collection of massive amounts
of personal data.  The **Future** will see a resurgence of interest in
causal reasoning, knowledge graphs (frames), accessible AI, and
federated data privacy.

This era that we now find ourselves is setting the foundations for the
technological developments toward artificial intelligence. The
foundations are emerging from the researhc laboratories and through
the `r Link("MLHub", "https://mlhub.ai")` we are able to utilise these
developments. The MLHub, put simply, aims to share the latest
algorithms and models within a framework that is easy for people to
build the models to share and a platform that is easy for anyone to
explore.
