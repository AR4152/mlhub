  abstract     = {Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R is divided into
                  two basic parts, the first presenting R packages,
                  functions, classes and methods for handling spatial
                  data.  This part is of interest to users who need to
                  access and visualise spatial data.  Data import and
                  export for many file formats for spatial data are
                  covered in detail, as is the interface between R and
                  the open source GRASS GIS. The second part showcases
                  more specialised kinds of spatial data analysis,
                  including spatial point pattern analysis,
                  interpolation and geostatistics, areal data analysis
                  and disease mapping.  The coverage of methods of
                  spatial data analysis ranges from standard
                  techniques to new developments, and the examples
                  used are largely taken from the spatial statistics
                  literature.  All the examples can be run using R
                  contributed packages available from the CRAN
                  website, with code and additional data sets from the
                  book's own website.  This book will be of interest
                  to researchers who intend to use R to handle,
                  visualise, and analyse spatial data.  It will also
                  be of interest to spatial data analysts who do not
                  use R, but who are interested in practical aspects
                  of implementing software for spatial data analysis.
                  It is a suitable companion book for introductory
                  spatial statistics courses and for applied methods
                  courses in a wide range of subjects using spatial
                  data, including human and physical geography,
                  geographical information systems, the environmental
                  sciences, ecology, public health and disease
                  control, economics, public administration and
                  political science.  The book has a website where
                  coloured figures, complete code examples, data sets,
                  and other support material may be found:

                  interactive and dynamic graphics as part of

                  clustering, supervised classification, and working
                  with missing values.  A variety of plots and
                  interaction methods are used in each analysis, often
                  starting with brushing linked low-dimensional views
                  and working up to manual manipulation of tours of
                  several variables.  The role of graphical methods is
                  shown at each step of the analysis, not only in the
                  early exploratory phase, but in the later stages,
                  too, when comparing and evaluating models.  All
                  examples are based on freely available software:
                  GGobi for interactive graphics and R for static
                  graphics, modeling, and programming.  The printed
                  book is augmented by a wealth of material on the
                  web, encouraging readers follow the examples
                  themselves.  The web site has all the data and code
                  necessary to reproduce the analyses in the book,

  abstract     = {Bayesian Computation with R introduces Bayesian
                  modeling by the use of computation using the R
                  language.  The early chapters present the basic
                  tenets of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one
                  and two-parameter inferential problems.  Bayesian
                  computational methods such as Laplace's method,
                  rejection sampling, and the SIR algorithm are
                  illustrated in the context of a random effects
                  model.  The construction and implementation of
                  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is
                  introduced.  These simulation-based algorithms are
                  implemented for a variety of Bayesian applications
                  such as normal and binary response regression,
                  hierarchical modeling, order-restricted inference,
                  and robust modeling.  Algorithms written in R are
                  used to develop Bayesian tests and assess Bayesian
                  models by use of the posterior predictive
                  distribution.  The use of R to interface with
                  WinBUGS, a popular MCMC computing language, is
                  described with several illustrative examples.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying shape and size variation is essential in
                  evolutionary biology and in many other disciplines.
                  Since the ``morphometric revolution of the 90s,'' an
                  increasing number of publications in applied and
                  theoretical morphometrics emerged in the new
                  discipline of statistical shape analysis.  The R
                  language and environment offers a single platform to
                  perform a multitude of analyses from the acquisition
                  of data to the production of static and interactive
                  graphs.  This offers an ideal environment to analyze
                  shape variation and shape change.  This open-source
                  language is accessible for novices and for
                  experienced users.  Adopting R gives the user and
                  developer several advantages for performing
                  morphometrics: evolvability, adaptability,
                  interactivity, a single and comprehensive platform,
                  possibility of interfacing with other languages and
                  software, custom analyses, and graphs.  The book
                  explains how to use R for morphometrics and provides
                  a series of examples of codes and displays covering
                  approaches ranging from traditional morphometrics to
                  modern statistical shape analysis such as the
                  analysis of landmark data, Thin Plate Splines, and
                  Fourier analysis of outlines.  The book fills two
                  gaps: the gap between theoreticians and students by
                  providing worked examples from the acquisition of
                  data to analyses and hypothesis testing, and the gap
                  between user and developers by providing and
                  explaining codes for performing all the steps
                  necessary for morphometrics rather than providing a
                  manual for a given software or package.  Students
                  and scientists interested in shape analysis can use
                  the book as a reference for performing applied
                  morphometrics, while prospective researchers will
                  learn how to implement algorithms or interfacing R
                  for new methods.  In addition, adopting the R
                  philosophy will enhance exchanges within and outside
                  the morphometrics community.  Julien Claude is
                  evolutionary biologist and palaeontologist at the
                  University of Montpellier 2 where he got his
                  Ph.D. in 2003.  He works on biodiversity and

                  accessible to readers with only a basic familiarity
                  with probability, yet allows more advanced readers
                  to quickly grasp the principles underlying Bayesian
                  theory and methods.  R code is provided throughout
                  the text. Much of the example code can be run ``as
                  is'' in R, and essentially all of it can be run
                  after downloading the relevant datasets from the
                  companion website for this book.  },

  abstract     = {This book is very different from any other
                  publication in the field and it is unique because of
                  its focus on the practical implementation of the
                  simulation and estimation methods presented.  The
                  book should be useful to practitioners and students
                  with minimal mathematical background, but because of
                  the many R programs, probably also to many
                  mathematically well educated practitioners.  Many of
                  the methods presented in the book have, so far, not
                  been used much in practice because the lack of an
                  implementation in a unified framework.  This book
                  fills the gap.  With the R code included in this
                  book, a lot of useful methods become easy to use for
                  practitioners and students.  An R package called
                  `sde' provides functionswith easy interfaces ready
                  to be used on empirical data from real life
                  applications.  Although it contains a wide range of
                  results, the book has an introductory character and
                  necessarily does not cover the whole spectrum of
                  simulation and inference for general stochastic
                  differential equations.  The book is organized in
                  four chapters.  The first one introduces the subject
                  and presents several classes of processes used in
                  many fields of mathematics, computational biology,
                  finance and the social sciences.  The second chapter
                  is devoted to simulation schemes and covers new
                  methods not available in other milestones
                  publication known so far.  The third one is focused
                  on parametric estimation techniques.  In particular,
                  it includes exact likelihood inference, approximated
                  and pseudo-likelihood methods, estimating functions,
                  generalized method of moments and other techniques.
                  The last chapter contains miscellaneous topics like
                  nonparametric estimation, model identification and
                  change point estimation.  The reader non-expert in R
                  language, will find a concise introduction to this
                  environment focused on the subject of the book which
                  should allow for instant use of the proposed
                  material.  To each R functions presented in the book
                  a documentation page is available at the end of the
                  book.},

                  by providing an accessible introduction to the
                  subject, filled with examples drawn from the social
                  and political sciences.  Readers are introduced to
                  the principles of nonparametric smoothing and to a
                  wide variety of smoothing methods.  The author also
                  explains how smoothing methods can be incorporated
                  into parametric linear and generalized linear
                  models.  The use of smoothers with these standard
                  statistical models allows the estimation of more
                  flexible functional forms whilst retaining the
                  interpretability of parametric models.  The full
                  potential of these techniques is highlighted via the
                  use of detailed empirical examples drawn from the
                  social and political sciences.  Each chapter

  abstract     = {Wavelet methods have recently undergone a rapid
                  period of development with important implications
                  for a number of disciplines including statistics.
                  This book fulfils three purposes.  First, it is a
                  gentle introduction to wavelets and their uses in
                  statistics.  Second, it acts as a quick and broad
                  reference to many recent developments in the area.
                  The book concentrates on describing the essential
                  elements and provides comprehensive source material
                  references.  Third, the book intersperses R code
                  that explains and demonstrates both wavelet and
                  statistical methods.  The code permits the user to
                  learn the methods, to carry out their own analyses
                  and further develop their own methods.  The book is
                  designed to be read in conjunction with WaveThresh4,
                  the freeware R package for wavelets.  The book
                  introduces the wavelet transform by starting with
                  the simple Haar wavelet transform and then builds to
                  consider more general wavelets such as the
                  Daubechies compactly supported series.  The book
                  then describes the evolution of wavelets in the
                  directions of complex-valued wavelets, non-decimated
                  transforms, multiple wavelets and wavelet packets as
                  well as giving consideration to boundary conditions
                  initialization.  Later chapters explain the role of
                  wavelets in nonparametric regression problems via a
                  variety of techniques including thresholding,
                  cross-validation, SURE, false-discovery rate and
                  recent Bayesian methods, and also consider how to
                  deal with correlated and non-Gaussian noise
                  structures.  The book also looks at how nondecimated
                  and packet transforms can improve performance.  The
                  penultimate chapter considers the role of wavelets
                  in both stationary and non-stationary time series
                  analysis.  The final chapter describes recent work
                  concerning the role of wavelets for variance
                  stabilization for non-Gaussian intensity estimation.
                  The book is aimed at final year undergraduate and
                  Masters students in a numerate discipline (such as
                  mathematics, statistics, physics, economics and
                  engineering) and would also suit as a quick
                  reference for postgraduate or research level
                  activity.  The book would be ideal for a researcher
                  to learn about wavelets, to learn how to use wavelet
                  software and then to adapt the ideas for their own
                  purposes.},

                  researchers to more accurately assess the health
                  effects of ambient air pollution.  The methods and
                  software developed in this area are applicable to a
                  wide array of problems in environmental
                  epidemiology.  This book provides an overview of the
                  methods used for investigating the health effects of
                  air pollution and gives examples and case studies in
                  R which demonstrate the application of those methods
                  to real data.  The book will be useful to
                  statisticians, epidemiologists, and graduate
                  students working in the area of air pollution and
                  health and others analyzing similar data.  The
                  authors describe the different existing approaches
                  to statistical modeling and cover basic aspects of
                  analyzing and understanding air pollution and health
                  data.  The case studies in each chapter demonstrate
                  how to use R to apply and interpret different
                  statistical models and to explore the effects of
                  potential confounding factors.  A working knowledge
                  of R and regression modeling is assumed.  In-depth
                  knowledge of R programming is not required to
                  understand and run the examples.  Researchers in
                  this area will find the book useful as a ``live''
                  reference.  Software for all of the analyses in the
                  book is downloadable from the web and is available
                  under a Free Software license.  The reader is free
                  to run the examples in the book and modify the code
                  to suit their needs.  In addition to providing the
                  software for developing the statistical models, the

  abstract     = {Few books on statistical data analysis in the
                  natural sciences are written at a level that a
                  non-statistician will easily understand.  This is a
                  book written in colloquial language, avoiding
                  mathematical formulae as much as possible, trying to
                  explain statistical methods using examples and
                  graphics instead. To use the book efficiently,
                  readers should have some computer experience. The
                  book starts with the simplest of statistical
                  concepts and carries readers forward to a deeper and
                  more extensive understanding of the use of
                  statistics in environmental sciences.  The book
                  concerns the application of statistical and other
                  computer methods to the management, analysis and
                  display of spatial data.  These data are
                  characterised by including locations (geographic
                  coordinates), which leads to the necessity of using
                  maps to display the data and the results of the
                  statistical methods. Although the book uses examples
                  from applied geochemistry, and a large geochemical
                  survey in particular, the principles and ideas
                  equally well apply to other natural sciences, e.g.,
                  environmental sciences, pedology, hydrology,
                  geography, forestry, ecology, and health
                  sciences/epidemiology.  The book is unique because
                  it supplies direct access to software solutions
                  (based on R, the Open Source version of the
                  S-language for statistics) for applied environmental
                  statistics. For all graphics and tables presented in
                  the book, the R-scripts are provided in the form of
                  executable R-scripts.  In addition, a graphical user
                  interface for R, called DAS+R, was developed for
                  convenient, fast and interactive data analysis.
                  Statistical Data Analysis Explained: Applied
                  Environmental Statistics with R provides, on an
                  accompanying website, the software to undertake all
                  the procedures discussed, and the data employed for
                  their description in the book.}

                  display and statistical analysis of experiments from
                  the applied sciences.  Currently, R offers a wide
                  range of functionality for nonlinear regression
                  analysis, but the relevant functions, packages and
                  documentation are scattered across the R
                  environment.  This book provides a coherent and
                  unified treatment of nonlinear regression with R by
                  means of examples from a diversity of applied
                  sciences such as biology, chemistry, engineering,
                  medicine and toxicology.  The book starts out giving
                  a basic introduction to fitting nonlinear regression
                  models in R.  Subsequent chapters explain the
                  salient features of the main fitting function nls(),
                  the use of model diagnostics, how to deal with
                  various model departures, and carry out hypothesis
                  testing.  In the final chapter grouped-data
                  structures, including an example of a nonlinear
                  mixed-effects regression model, are considered.},

                  tools and techniques for building regression models
                  using real-world data and assessing their validity.
                  When weaknesses in the model are identified, the
                  next step is to address each of these weaknesses.  A
                  key theme throughout the book is that it makes sense
                  to base inferences or conclusions only on valid
                  models.  The regression output and plots that appear
                  throughout the book have been generated using R.  On
                  the book website you will find the R code used in
                  each example in the text.  You will also find SAS
                  code and STATA code to produce the equivalent output
                  on the book website.  Primers containing expanded
                  explanations of R, SAS and STATA and their use in
                  this book are also available on the book website.
                  The book contains a number of new real data sets
                  from applications ranging from rating restaurants,
                  rating wines, predicting newspaper circulation and
                  magazine revenue, comparing the performance of NFL
                  kickers, and comparing finalists in the Miss America
                  pageant across states.  One of the aspects of the

                  Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis in
                  Chemometrics presents simple yet thorough
                  explanations of the most important multivariate
                  statistical methods for analyzing chemical data.  It
                  includes discussions of various statistical methods,
                  such as principal component analysis, regression
                  analysis, classification methods, and clustering.
                  Written by a chemometrician and a statistician, the
                  book reflects both the practical approach of
                  chemometrics and the more formally oriented one of
                  statistics.  To enable a better understanding of the
                  statistical methods, the authors apply them to real
                  data examples from chemistry.  They also examine
                  results of the different methods, comparing
                  traditional approaches with their robust
                  counterparts.  In addition, the authors use the
                  freely available R package to implement methods,
                  encouraging readers to go through the examples and
                  adapt the procedures to their own problems.
                  Focusing on the practicality of the methods and the
                  validity of the results, this book offers concise
                  mathematical descriptions of many multivariate
                  methods and employs graphical schemes to visualize
                  key concepts.  It effectively imparts a basic
                  understanding of how to apply statistical methods to
                  multivariate scientific data.}

                  and its extensions in analysing ecological data.  As

                  postgraduate ecological studies or research projects
                  are used throughout.  The first part of the book is
                  a largely non-mathematical introduction to linear
                  mixed effects modelling, GLM and GAM, zero inflated
                  models, GEE, GLMM and GAMM.  The second part
                  provides ten case studies that range from koalas to
                  deep sea research.  These chapters provide an
                  invaluable insight into analysing complex ecological
                  datasets, including comparisons of different

                  environment of choice for data analysis and graphics
                  both in academia and industry.  Lattice brings the
                  proven design of Trellis graphics (originally
                  developed for S by William S. Cleveland and
                  colleagues at Bell Labs) to R, considerably
                  expanding its capabilities in the process.  Lattice
                  is a powerful and elegant high level data
                  visualization system that is sufficient for most
                  everyday graphics needs, yet flexible enough to be
                  easily extended to handle demands of cutting edge
                  research.  Written by the author of the lattice
                  system, this book describes it in considerable
                  depth, beginning with the essentials and
                  systematically delving into specific low levels
                  details as necessary.  No prior experience with
                  lattice is required to read the book, although basic
                  familiarity with R is assumed.  The book contains
                  close to 150 figures produced with lattice.  Many of
                  the examples emphasize principles of good graphical
                  design; almost all use real data sets that are
                  publicly available in various R packages.  All code
                  and figures in the book are also available online,

  abstract     = {Since its inception, R has become one of the
                  preeminent programs for statistical computing and
                  data analysis.  The ready availability of the
                  program, along with a wide variety of packages and
                  the supportive R community make R an excellent
                  choice for almost any kind of computing task related
                  to statistics.  However, many users, especially
                  those with experience in other languages, do not
                  take advantage of the full power of R.  Because of
                  the nature of R, solutions that make sense in other
                  languages may not be very efficient in R.  This book
                  presents a wide array of methods applicable for
                  reading data into R, and efficiently manipulating
                  that data.  In addition to the built-in functions, a
                  number of readily available packages from CRAN (the
                  Comprehensive R Archive Network) are also covered.
                  All of the methods presented take advantage of the
                  core features of R: vectorization, efficient use of
                  subscripting, and the proper use of the varied
                  functions in R that are provided for common data
                  management tasks.  Most experienced R users discover
                  that, especially when working with large data sets,
                  it may be helpful to use other programs, notably
                  databases, in conjunction with R.  Accordingly, the
                  use of databases in R is covered in detail, along
                  with methods for extracting data from spreadsheets
                  and datasets created by other programs.  Character
                  manipulation, while sometimes overlooked within R,
                  is also covered in detail, allowing problems that
                  are traditionally solved by scripting languages to
                  be carried out entirely within R.  For users with
                  experience in other languages, guidelines for the
                  effective use of programming constructs like loops
                  are provided.  Since many statistical modeling and
                  graphics functions need their data presented in a
                  data frame, techniques for converting the output of
                  commonly used functions to data frames are provided
                  throughout the book.  Using a variety of examples
                  based on data sets included with R, along with
                  easily simulated data sets, the book is recommended
                  to anyone using R who wishes to advance from simple
                  examples to practical real-life data manipulation
                  solutions.}

                  being directed towards the problem of how to better
                  focus on the most precious nuggets. This paper
                  presents the hot spots methodology, adopting a
                  multi-strategy and interactive approach to help
                  focus on the important nuggets. The methodology
                  first performs data mining and then explores the
                  resulting models to find the important nuggets
                  contained therein. This approach is demonstrated in
                  insurance and fraud applications.},

                  interfaces for accessing data and for delivering
                  results. By developing standards, new tools can plug
                  into the environment with a minimum of effort,
                  providing `Plug-n-Play' opportunities with new tools
                  as they become available. Data can be accessed from
                  Database systems through ODBC and JDBC, or from
                  other sources and managed internally within the
                  Arcade. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used
                  as the target "language'' for all Data Mining tools
                  within the environment. The Predictive Modelling
                  Markup Language (PMML) developed by UIC is an
                  example of the XML markup that the system
                  handles. Data Mining tools produce as their output
                  documents that conform to PMML. These can then be
                  visualised, run, or combined with other models as

  abstract     = {In the theory of linear models, the concept of
                  degrees of freedom plays an important role. This
                  concept is often used for measurement of model
                  complexity, for obtaining an unbiased estimate of
                  the error variance, and for comparison of different
                  models. I have developed a concept of generalized
                  degrees of freedom (GDF) that is applicable to
                  complex modeling procedures. The definition is based
                  on the sum of the sensitivity of each fitted value
                  to perturbation in the corresponding observed
                  value. The concept is nonasymptotic in nature and
                  does not require analytic knowledge of the modeling
                  procedures. The concept of GDF offers a unified
                  framework under which complex and highly irregular
                  modeling procedures can be analyzed in the same way
                  as classical linear models. By using this framework,
                  many difficult problems can be solved easily. For
                  example, one can now measure the number of
                  observations used in a variable selection
                  process. Different modeling procedures, such as a
                  tree-based regression and a projection pursuit
                  regression, can be compared on the basis of their
                  residual sums of squares and the GDF that they
                  cost. I apply the proposed framework to measure the
                  effect of variable selection in linear models,
                  leading to corrections of selection bias in various
                  goodness-of-fit statistics. The theory also has
                  interesting implications for the effect of general
                  model searching by a human modeler.}

                  time, statistical methods are kept to a minimum.
                  The text covers how to download and install R,

                  introduction to functions, advanced plotting, and
                  common beginner mistakes.  This book contains
