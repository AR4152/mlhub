# azcv --- Azure Computer Vision {#azcv}

`r CiteDate(20200806)` The [MLHub](https://mlhub.ai) package
[azcv](https://github.com/gjwgit/azcv) utilises the Azure Computer
Vision cloud API. The pacakge provides a demonstration, a graphical
user interface, and command line tools that utilise pre-built models
from [Azure Computer
Vision](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Computer-vision). Individual
command line tools are packaged for common computer vision tasks
including image analysis to extract descriptions of the images, word
recognition from images, landmark identification, thumbnail
generation, and more. The command line tools can be used within
command pipelines for tasks including the tagging of personal photos
folder, analysis of images from a cameras monitoring a bird feeder,
reading street signs to support a driver, and reading handwritten
texts.

A free Azure subscription allowing up to 5,000 transactions per month
with a maximum of 20 per minute (according to [Azure
Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/details/cognitive-services/computer-vision/))
is available from <https://azure.microsoft.com/free/>. After
subscribing visit <https://portal.azure.com> and Create a resource
under AI and Machine Learning called Cognitive Services. Once created
you can access the web API subscription key and endpoint from the
portal. This will be prompted for when running a command, and then
saved to file to reduce the need for repeated authentication requests.

These Azure models, unlike the MLHub models in general, use *closed
source services* which have no guarantee of ongoing availability and
do not come with the freedom to modify and share.

To install and configure mlhub:

```bash
$ pip3 install mlhub
$ ml configure
```

To install and configure the package:

```bash
$ ml install   azcv
$ ml configure azcv
$ ml readme    azcv
$ ml commands  azcv
```

To run a canned demonstration or an interactive GUI:

```bash
$ ml demo azcv
$ ml gui azcv
```

The *azcv* package provides a collection of useful command line
tools. Most commands take an image as a parameter which may be a url
or a path to a local file. For brevity URLs used here are generated
through [bitly](https://bitly.com).

## azcv category

The *category* command takes an image and categorises it based on a
taxonomy-based of [86
concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Computer-vision/concept-categorizing-images).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/master/ComputerVision/Images/landmark.jpg)

```console
$ ml category azcv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/master/ComputerVision/Images/landmark.jpg
0.32,building_
0.00,others_
0.04,outdoor_
```

## azcv landmarks

The *landmarks* command takes an image
and identifies the main landmarks contained within the image. The
confidence of the identification is also returned.

![](http://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2013/11/marina_bay_sands_singapore_a_l.jpg)

```console
$ ml landmarks azcv http://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2013/11/marina_bay_sands_singapore_a_l.jpg
0.95,Marina Bay Sands
```

## azcv tags

The *tags* command takes an image (url or path to a local file) and
generates a collection of tags that identify key elements of the
image. Each tag has a confidence.

![](https://www.wayoutback.com.au/assets/Uploads/Uluru.jpg)

```console
$ ml tags azcv https://www.wayoutback.com.au/assets/Uploads/Uluru.jpg

## azcv objects

The *objects* command returns the bounding box of any identified
objects within the image.

```console
$ ml objects azcv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/master/ComputerVision/Images/objects.jpg

```

## azcv ocr street signs

The *ocr* command, for optical character recognition, is useful for
extracting text from a variety of images.

An important use case for OCR today is the reading of street
signs. Here we use OCR to identify all text in the image, including
the street sign, the bus text, and even text from a sign post. The
bounding boxes are returned together with the identified text.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gjwgit/azcv/master/docs/semarang.jpg)

```console
$ ml ocr azcv https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3883/15144849957_f326e03f75_b.jpg
341.0 122.0 606.0 120.0 607.0 158.0 342.0 160.0,SEMARANG
251.0 200.0 559.0 199.0 560.0 237.0 252.0 238.0,PURWODADI
251.0 250.0 456.0 249.0 456.0 288.0 252.0 289.0,BLORA
...
```

See [Reading Street Signs](STREET.md) for further details and examples.


## azcv ocr handwritting

Handwriting is recognisable with today's OCR.  The bounding box of the
text together with the text itself is returned by the command.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gjwgit/azcv/master/docs/handwriting_demo.png)

See [Extract Text for Handwriting](HAND_WRITING.md) for further details and examples.

## azcv ocr programming code

Imagine the use case where we may have access to an image of some
programming code and want to recover that code to include it into an
actual program, without manually re-typing it. We can again use
OCR. Here the bounding boxes have been filtered out and just the code
is shown.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gjwgit/azcv/master/docs/code_demo.png)

See [Extract Code from Screenshots](CODE.md) for further details and examples.

## azcv thumbnail

Thumbnails require more than simply generating a small square section
from an image. Ideally it is in some way representative of the
image. The *thumbnail* command will choose a "good" region of the
image to display as a thumbnail.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gjwgit/azcv/master/docs/eiffel_thumbnail.png)

```console
$ ml thumbnail azcv img.jpg
img-thumbnail.jpg
```
See [Thumbnail Examples](THUMBNAIL.md) for further details and examples.

```console
$ ml brands azcv https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/images/gray-shirt-logo.jpg

```

## azcv adult material

Check if an image contains adult material. The first result is an
indication 0-1 of whether the image appears to contain adult material
whilst the second is an indication of whether the image might be
considered as racy. The third is for gory content.

```console
$ ml adult azcv https://aaa/aaa01.jpg
0.72,1.00,0.45

$ ml adult azcv https://aaa/aaa02.jpg
0.02,0.03,0.92

$ ml adult azcv https://aaa/aaa03.jpg
0.00,0.99,0.00
```

## azcv color schemes

The output consists of a boolean to indicate if it is not a black and
white image, the accent (most vibrant) colour, the dominant background
and foreground, and then a list of dominant colors. In the examples
below we include the accent colour beside the original image.

```console
$ ml color azcv https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Computer-vision/images/mountain_vista.png

## azcv type of image

An image may be regarded as clip art and/or a line drawing. The *type*
command assesses whether the image is good/ok clip art in the first
result and whether or not it is a line drawing as the second result.
